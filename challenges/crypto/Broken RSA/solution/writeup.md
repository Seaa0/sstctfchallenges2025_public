# Broken RSA
## Prerequisites
To understand this writeup, you should know the concept of group theory, group orders, and understand how RSA operates on the group of $(Z/pZ)^\times$. This [deck of slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FKFo3BMrPr8ij0Avz7o_8JARnh4OiPCUNsN0VAIFnsk), created by Warri, is good for learning group theory. 
## Overview
This challenge can be split into 2 parts:
1. Deciding n
2. Deriving d
3. Decryption
### Deciding n
We aim to have `gcd(phi,e)` be as low as possible, so we pick a prime $n=2p+1$ where p is a prime. This is such that $\phi=2p$, hence `gcd(phi,e)==2`.

### Deriving d
Since the order of the subgroup generated by m is not always $\phi$, we are banking on ~50% chance of the order being $\phi/2$. This is so that `gcd(order,e) == 1`. Since we also know $e$ and $\phi$, we can derive $d$.

### Decryption
$m = c^d \mod n$
