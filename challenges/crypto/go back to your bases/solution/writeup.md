# Go back to your bases
We are given this string `c3N0Y3Rme2I0czNfNjRfaDRzX24wX2MxcGgzcl9rZXl9` which as we can infer from the title is encrypted in a certain kind of base.  
In this case it is encrypted in base64, thus by decoding it (from any of your favourite websites, https://www.base64decode.org/ for example), we obtain the flag  
Flag: `sstctf{b4s3_64_h4s_n0_c1ph3r_key}`
