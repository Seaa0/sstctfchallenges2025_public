# Weird Notation
I found some weird notation here, but I can't understand? All I know is that it's some algorithm...can you find the name of it?

R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F'

Note: wrap the flag in sstctf{}, and make it all small letters, with spaces separated by underscores
e.g. sstctf{foolscap_paper}
